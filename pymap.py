This program should be a small wrapper around nmap.
 * Ask the user for an ip then give options (ignore ports, quick port scan, service scan, full scan, etc)
 * Spawn nmap using subprocess, make sure it is a daemon,
   output of the command should go into a file with ip address as the name
 * Repeat above steps until they exit
